Zoom 30MFF Website 

Project Description 

[Link to video]( https://dev-kalavadia.github.io/30MFF-Assignment1.github.io/)

The project started with us shooting a 30 minute video during class and my group and I decided to make un ironic zoom promotional/advertisement. This one minute video brings out the features of the video conferencing app to sarcasm in real life scenarios that we are students face on a day-to-day basis due to online learning. Personally I wanted to use this irony and make a mock up zoom website with our video embedded. While I was promoting and highlighting all its features the video would be telling a different story if they user a clicked on it. I wanted to surprise the user and bring a smile on their face as they would be not expecting the mock video compared to the realistic and similar zoom website. Obviously due to copyright and trademark issues I was not making any kind of sales or business neither does it intend to have any other used for this website other than this project for the class. I also had to change the wire frame as redirecting users to the actual zoom site would not be a great idea.


Process: 

I started by brainstorming some ideas as to how I could use this an implement it using the video for this project. I started by doing my research and going through Zoom's actual website and seeing how they are promoting their software. Although I did not want to be heavily inspired by the site I had to draw inspiration since I could not have made it different from the video itself. After this I started to create a wireframe on Adobe XD and started to visualize how many website would look like. After this I started to look for my graphics in particular the logo, pictures of team members and the how i could embed though video link onto my page.
During the designing phase, I also decided on the theme and the color palette i will be using. 

After this I started the coding process and begin with creating the navigation and the body itself and synchronizing the two; HTML and CSS file in sequential order so that the cascading will take place correctly. 
Throughout the coding process I had to regularly look up CSS and html syntax and using peoples answers on stackoverflow as refernce. I also came across a few interesting bootstraps designs which I really liked but I could not implement any into my website since it was meant to be coded from scratch. While the CSS positioning was the hardest part of this assignment I felt that it had really challenged me and pushed my father to learn more syntax which I never paid much attention to become comfortable and fluid with the language. I also tried my best to keep the code as responsive as possible but I failed in some sections since the CSS positioning started to make the website look messy, I had to resort to hard coding in some sections.

Reflection/Evaluation

This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
Personally I believe I did my best and really enjoyed doing the basics of what government has a gave me a deeper understanding of how fundamental aspects and how markup code actually works. It also allowed me to get comfortable with incorporating icons an SVG along with trying out different colors and different find families.
Something that I really wanted to achieve in this assignment was a typewriter effect to JavaScript. However due to my lack of knowledge and experience in JS I could not get it to work completely. Even though there were a lot of examples on the web I did not want to start using code which I was not comfortable with as it wouldn't help me in anyway since I wouldn't be understanding most of it. However I believe by the end of this course I should be able to use advanced JavaScript effects and create a better user experience through interactive and responsive code.
